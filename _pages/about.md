Lab brief
======
The GeoDISS Lab within the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IOTSC) at University of Macau is dedicated to breaking through research and application bottlenecks in geological-hydrological-geotechnical disaster mitigation, aiming to promote public safety and urban sustainability. We have a dual research focus: fundamental physical mechanisms with novel insights and practical solutions with real-world impact. We boost our research by a blend of traditional experiment/numerical/field methods with interdisciplinary methods such as SLAM, computer vision, geophysical multi-modal data, and sensor fusion. Check out our continuously updated Research and Publications.üèÑüèÑüèÑ

Welcome to join
=====
Welcome to join us if you're interested in these areas and solving real-world problems. We are always looking for PhD applicants with strong interest, passion, and motivation in disaster mitigation and urban sustainability. Admission to UM PhD program has recently been highly competitive, so we tend to prioritize candidates with research & operational ability, especially those who have intense practical product experiences or papers published at major engineering geology/hydrology/geotechnical/machine learning/computer vision journals or conferences. Considering we need to develop new monitoring-warning systems and process multi-modal data, proficiency in general programming is a big plus. To apply, please kindly send your resume to me (pingshen@um.edu.mo), optionally but encouragedly with brief research proposal and past work demo. Each accepted applicant will be fully funded for four years. 

About me
======
I am an Assistant Professor at the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IOTSC) at University of Macau. I obtained my PhD degree (2019) from Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research areas are physical mechanisms and practical solutions in geological-hydrological-geotechnical disasters affecting human activity, mainly including landslide, debris flow, flooding, underground pipelines, etc. Besides, urban sustaintability, especially interactions between urban disasters and human dynamics, are rising in my focus.
